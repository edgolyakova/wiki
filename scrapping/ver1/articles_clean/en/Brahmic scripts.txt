A Sanskrit Phrase in different Brahmic Scripts.
The Brahmic scripts, also known as Indic scripts, are a family of abugida writing systems.
They are used throughout the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and parts of East Asia.
They are descended from the Brahmi script of ancient India and are used by various languages in several language families in South, East and Southeast Asia: Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, Mongolic, Austroasiatic, Austronesian, and Tai.
They were also the source of the dictionary order (gojūon) of Japanese kana.

History
Brahmic scripts descended from the Brahmi script.
Brahmi is clearly attested from the 3rd century BCE during the reign of Ashoka, who used the script for imperial edicts, but there are some claims of earlier epigraphy found on pottery in southern India and Sri Lanka.
The most reliable of these were short Brahmi inscriptions dated to the 4th century BCE and published by Coningham et al. (1996). 
Northern Brahmi gave rise to the Gupta script during the Gupta period, which in turn diversified into a number of cursives during the medieval period.
Notable examples of such medieval scripts, developed by the 7th or 8th century, include Nagari, Siddham and Sharada.
The Siddhaṃ script was especially important in Buddhism, as many sutras were written in it.
The art of Siddham calligraphy survives today in Japan.
The tabular presentation and dictionary order of the modern kana system of Japanese writing is believed to be descended from the Indic scripts, most likely through the spread of Buddhism.
Southern Brahmi evolved into the Kadamba, Pallava and Vatteluttu scripts, which in turn diversified into other scripts of South India and Southeast Asia.
Brahmic scripts spread in a peaceful manner, Indianization, or the spread of Indian learning.
The scripts spread naturally to Southeast Asia, at ports on trading routes.
At these trading posts, ancient inscriptions have been found in Sanskrit, using scripts that originated in India.
At first, inscriptions were made in Indian languages, but later the scripts were used to write the local Southeast Asian languages.
Hereafter, local varieties of the scripts were developed.
By the 8th century, the scripts had diverged and separated into regional scripts.

Some characteristics, which are present in most but not all the scripts, are:
Each consonant has an inherent vowel which is usually a short ‘ə’ (in Bengali, Assamese and Odia, the phoneme is /ɔ/ due to sound shifts). Other vowels are written by adding to the character.
A mark, known in Sanskrit as a virama/halanta, can be used to indicate the absence of an inherent vowel.
Each vowel has two forms, an independent form when not attached to a consonant, and a dependent form, when attached to a consonant.
Depending on the script, the dependent forms can be either placed to the left of, to the right of, above, below, or on both the left and the right sides of the base consonant.
Consonants (up to 4 in Devanagari) can be combined in ligatures.
Special marks are added to denote the combination of 'r' with another consonant.
Nasalization and aspiration of a consonant's dependent vowel is also noted by separate signs.
The alphabetical order is: vowels, velar consonants, palatal consonants, retroflex consonants, dental consonants, bilabial consonants, approximants, sibilants, and other consonants.
Each consonant grouping had four stops (with all four possible values of voicing and aspiration), and a nasal consonant.
Comparison
Below are comparison charts of several of the major Indic scripts, organised on the principle that glyphs in the same column all derive from the same Brahmi glyph.  Accordingly:
The charts are not comprehensive.
Glyphs may be unrepresented if they do not derive from any Brahmi character, but are later inventions.
The pronunciations of glyphs in the same column may not be identical.  The pronunciation row is only representative; the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) pronunciation is given for Sanskrit where possible, or another language if necessary.
The transliteration is indicated in ISO 15919.

Notes
This list tries to include characters of same origins, not same sounds.
In Bengali র is pronounced as rô but it is originally va which is still used for wa sound in Mithilakshar and modern Assamese ৱ (wabbô) was derived from middle Assamese র (wô). Compare with জ (ja) য (ya) and য় (ẏ) which are pronounced as jô,  jô and yô in Bengali and zô, zô and yô in Assamese respectively. য is related to Devanagari य (ya) and it is still pronounced as "ya" in Mithilakshar.
Since their sounds shifted, the dots were added to keep the original sounds.
includes supplementary consonants not in contemporary use
inherent vowel is ā
a b c d e f g h i Modified forms of these letters are or were used for distinctions made in Thai; these distinctions are not made for Sanskrit and Pali in the Thai script.
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n These letters are obsolete, but were used mainly for Sanskrit and Pali in the Lao script.
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n Letters used in Old Javanese.
They are now obsolete, but are used for honorifics in contemporary Javanese.
Invented new character to represent the Arabic letter خ.
Letter used in Old Sundanese.
It is now obsolete.
Invented new character.
Actually to represent the Arabic letter ش, which has similar pronunciation with śa.
Vowels
Vowels are presented in their independent form on the left of each column, and in their corresponding dependent form (vowel sign) combined with the consonant k on the right.
A glyph for ka is an independent consonant letter itself without any vowel sign, where the vowel a is inherent.

List of Brahmic scripts
Historical
The Brahmi script was already divided into regional variants at the time of the earliest surviving epigraphy around the 3rd century BC. Cursives of the Brahmi script began to diversify further from around the 5th century AD and continued to give rise to new scripts throughout the Middle Ages.
The main division in antiquity was between northern and southern Brahmi.
In the northern group, the Gupta script was very influential, and in the southern group the Vatteluttu and Kadamba/Pallava scripts with the spread of Buddhism sent Brahmic scripts throughout Southeast Asia.[citation needed]
