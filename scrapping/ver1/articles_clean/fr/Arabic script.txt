The Arabic script is a writing system used for Arabic and several other languages of Asia and Africa.
It is the second-most widely used writing system in the world by number of countries using it, and the third-most by number of users (after the Latin and Chinese scripts).
The script was first used to write texts in Arabic, most notably the Quran, the holy book of Islam.
With the religion's spread, it came to be used as the primary script for many language families, leading to the addition of new letters and other symbols.
Such languages still using it are: Persian (Farsi/Dari), Malay (Jawi), Uyghur, Kurdish, Punjabi (Shahmukhi), Sindhi, Balti, Balochi, Pashto, Lurish, Urdu, Kashmiri, Rohingya, Somali and Mandinka, Mooré among others.
Until the 16th century, it was also used for some Spanish texts, and—prior to the language reform in 1928—it was the writing system of Turkish.
The script is written from right to left in a cursive style, in which most of the letters are written in slightly different forms according to whether they stand alone or are joined to a following or preceding letter.
However, the basic letter form remains unchanged.
The script does not have capital letters.
In most cases, the letters transcribe consonants, or consonants and a few vowels, so most Arabic alphabets are abjads, with the versions used for some languages, such as Sorani, Uyghur, Mandarin, and Serbo-Croatian, being alphabets.
It is also the basis for the tradition of Arabic calligraphy.

History[edit]
Main article: History of the Arabic alphabet
The Arabic alphabet is derived either from the Nabataean alphabet or (less widely believed) directly from the Syriac alphabet, which are both derived from the Aramaic alphabet (which also gave rise to the Hebrew alphabet), which, in turn, descended from the Phoenician alphabet.  In addition to the Aramaic script (and, therefore, the Arabic and Hebrew scripts), the Phoenician script also gave rise to the Greek alphabet (and, therefore, both the Cyrillic alphabet and the Latin alphabet used to write this article).
Origins[edit]
In the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, northern Arab tribes emigrated and founded a kingdom centred around Petra, Jordan.
These people (now named Nabataeans from the name of one of the tribes, Nabatu) spoke Nabataean Arabic, a dialect of the Arabic language.
In the 2nd or 1st centuries BCE, the first known records of the Nabataean alphabet were written in the Aramaic language (which was the language of communication and trade), but included some Arabic language features: the Nabataeans did not write the language which they spoke.
They wrote in a form of the Aramaic alphabet, which continued to evolve; it separated into two forms: one intended for inscriptions (known as "monumental Nabataean") and the other, more cursive and hurriedly written and with joined letters, for writing on papyrus.
This cursive form influenced the monumental form more and more and gradually changed into the Arabic alphabet.

The Arabic script has been adapted for use in a wide variety of languages besides Arabic, including Persian, Malay and Urdu, which are not Semitic.
Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent phonemes that do not appear in Arabic phonology.
For example, the Arabic language lacks a voiceless bilabial plosive (the [p] sound), therefore many languages add their own letter to represent [p] in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language.
These modifications tend to fall into groups: Indian and Turkic languages written in the Arabic script tend to use the Persian modified letters, whereas the languages of Indonesia tend to imitate those of Jawi.
The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the Perso-Arabic script by scholars.[citation needed]
When the Arabic script is used to write Serbo-Croatian, Sorani, Kashmiri, Mandarin Chinese, or Uyghur, vowels are mandatory.
The Arabic script can, therefore, be used as a true alphabet as well as an abjad, although it is often strongly, if erroneously, connected to the latter due to it being originally used only for Arabic.[citation needed]
Use of the Arabic script in West African languages, especially in the Sahel, developed with the spread of Islam.
To a certain degree the style and usage tends to follow those of the Maghreb (for instance the position of the dots in the letters fāʼ and qāf). Additional diacritics have come into use to facilitate the writing of sounds not represented in the Arabic language.
The term ʻAjamī, which comes from the Arabic root for "foreign," has been applied to Arabic-based orthographies of African languages.[citation needed]

Arabic
Garshuni (or Karshuni) originated in the 7th century, when Arabic became the dominant spoken language in the Fertile Crescent, but Arabic script was not yet fully developed or widely read, and so the Syriac alphabet was used.
There is evidence that writing Arabic in this other set of letters (known as Garshuni) influenced the style of modern Arabic script.
After this initial period, Garshuni writing has continued to the present day among some Syriac Christian communities in the Arabic-speaking regions of the Levant and Mesopotamia.

Former use[edit]
In the 20th century, the Arabic script was generally replaced by the Latin alphabet in the Balkans,[dubious  – discuss] parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, while in the Soviet Union, after a brief period of Latinisation, use of Cyrillic was mandated.
Turkey changed to the Latin alphabet in 1928 as part of an internal Westernizing revolution.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the Turkic languages of the ex-USSR attempted to follow Turkey's lead and convert to a Turkish-style Latin alphabet.
However, renewed use of the Arabic alphabet has occurred to a limited extent in Tajikistan, whose language's close resemblance to Persian allows direct use of publications from Afghanistan and Iran.

Footnotes:
From right: start, middle, end, and isolated forms.
Joined to the letter, closest to the letter, on the first letter, or above.
Further away from the letter, or on the second letter, or below.
A variant that end up with loop also exists.
Although the letter also known as Waw with Damma, some publications and fonts features filled Damma that looks similar to comma.
Shown in Naskh (top) and Nastaliq (bottom) styles.
The Nastaliq version of the connected forms are connected to each other, because the tatweel character U+0640 used to show the other forms does not work in many Nastaliq fonts.
Letter construction[edit]
Most languages that use alphabets based on the Arabic alphabet use the same base shapes.
Most additional letters in languages that use alphabets based on the Arabic alphabet are built by adding (or removing) diacritics to existing Arabic letters.
Some stylistic variants in Arabic have distinct meanings in other languages.
For example, variant forms of kāf  ك ک ڪ ‎ are used in some languages and sometimes have specific usages.
In Urdu and some neighbouring languages the letter Hā has diverged into two forms  ھ ‎ dō-čašmī hē and  ہ ہـ ـہـ ـہ ‎ gōl hē. while a variant form of  ي ‎ yā referred to as baṛī yē  ے ‎ is used at the end of some words.
