Abstract art;In Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the Tang dynasty painter Wang Mo (??), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.
Abstract art;While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings.
Abstract art;"The Chan buddhist painter Liang Kai (??, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his ""Immortal in splashed ink"" in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened."
Abstract art;A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to Tiantai buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese Zen painters.
Alan Turing;"When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece ""The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"" in January 1952."
Alan Turing;He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms.
Alan Turing;"He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction–diffusion system, could account for ""the main phenomena of morphogenesis""."
Alan Turing;He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions.
Alan Turing;For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations.
Alan Turing;Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A.
Alan Turing;If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did.
Alan Turing;To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand.
Alan Turing;These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots.
Alan Turing;The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics.
Alan Turing;Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
Alan Turing;Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.
Alan Turing;One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.
Alan Turing;"Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of ""feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest."""
Alan Turing;In 2012, Sheth, et al.
Alan Turing;found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.
Alan Turing;Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A. M. Turing was published in 1992.
Talmud;Within Humanistic Judaism, Talmud is studied as a historical text, in order to discover how it can demonstrate practical relevance to living today.
Traditional African religions;One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups.
Traditional African religions;In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness.
Traditional African religions;When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, adherents are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference.
Traditional African religions;This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life.
Traditional African religions;Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts.
Speech;In linguistics, articulatory phonetics is the study of how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs are used to make sounds.
Speech;Speech sounds are categorized by manner of articulation and place of articulation.
Speech;Place of articulation refers to where in the neck or mouth the airstream is constricted.
Speech;Manner of articulation refers to the manner in which the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g.
Speech;pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream.
Speech;The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization.
Speech;For any place of articulation, there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several homorganic consonants.
Speech;Normal human speech is pulmonic, produced with pressure from the lungs, which creates phonation in the glottis in the larynx, which is then modified by the vocal tract and mouth into different vowels and consonants.
Speech;However humans can pronounce words without the use of the lungs and glottis in alaryngeal speech, of which there are three types: esophageal speech, pharyngeal speech and buccal speech (better known as Donald Duck talk).
Speech;Speech production is a complex activity, and as a consequence errors are common, especially in children.
