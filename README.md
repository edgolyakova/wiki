# Project Brief
The project is dedicated to fine-tuning [OPUS-mt](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-mt) models with Wikipedia data using different types of annotation:
- No annotation
- Word-matching between source and target sentence
- PoS tagging

The experiments were performed for English to Mandarin Chinese and English to French language pairs.
